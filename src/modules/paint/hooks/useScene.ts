 * Vector shapes are cheap to store (~100 bytes) and cheap to replay.
 * SnapshotShapes are expensive to store (~15 MB) but instantaneous to restore
 * via putImageData — used for freeform strokes and fill operations.
 * ImageShapes store an HTMLImageElement reference and are replayed via drawImage.
